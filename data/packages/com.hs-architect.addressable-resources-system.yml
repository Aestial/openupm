  This is Addressables Wrapping Utility, a powerful wrapper solution for Unity's
  Addressables system.


  This package simplifies the complex Addressables API and streamlines your game
  development workflow:


  - AssetEntry System: Provides safe and consistent access to all addressable
  assets

  - Automatic Memory Management: Auto-release through MonoBehaviourTracker when
  instantiating

  - Synchronous and Asynchronous Instantiation: Support for both Instantiate and
  InstantiateAsync methods

  - Advanced Handle Tracking: Prevents memory leaks with HandleTrackingSystem

  - Efficient Asset Group Management: Optimizes memory usage through proper
  asset group organization

  - Unity 2023+ Support: High-performance asynchronous instantiation using
  AsyncInstantiateOperation


  This package is the optimal solution for simplifying resource loading
  management in large game projects, optimizing memory usage, and improving
  loading performance.


  Use this package to systematically manage assets and resources in large-scale
  projects.
